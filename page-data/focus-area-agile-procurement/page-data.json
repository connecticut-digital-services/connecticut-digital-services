Some failed to deliver completely. </p>\n<p>We’re committed to doing things differently. Adopting modern procurement practices allows us to minimize risks and costs while more effectively meeting our users’ needs.</p>\n<p>But what does that look like? Here's a few ways that agile procurement methods can be a game-changer:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attract modern, high quality vendors</li>\n<li>Implement evaluation methods that require vendors to show rather than tell</li>\n<li>Move quickly from RFP posting to delivering a minimum viable product (MVP)</li>\n<li>Structure IT projects in a modular way</li>\n<li>Establish standards by which new systems must communicate with each other</li>\n<li>Seamlessly replace under-performing vendors</li>\n<li>Engage the vendor community to improve procurement processes</li>\n<li>Implement agile and modular procurement practices that emphasize functional software and user research throughout each project</li>\n<li>Foster multi-year funding through capital and operating budgets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to learn more?
