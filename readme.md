# CT Digital Service

https://connecticut-digital-services.github.io/

**CT Digital is an open collaborative team with a vision to deliver better services to the people and businesses of Connecticut.**

You shouldnâ€™t have to understand how government works to work with government. And getting services and the information you need should take seconds, not months.

We want to change the way government works by designing with people of Connecticut, and making data-driven decisions.

We want to provide meaningful interactions, and we want to get there by working in the open, listening before doing, being iterative and flexible. Ultimately, we want to flip the model of government on its head.

If you want to learn more about what we're working on, or to work with us, send us an email helloctdigital@ct.gov.
