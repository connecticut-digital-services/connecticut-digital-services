## Challenge

Visitors to the Department of Motor Vehicles’s (DMV) website were becoming increasingly frustrated with their online experience. Users had trouble finding the information they needed. In addition, there were certain changes the DMV needed to make in its digital services as part of the REAL ID Act, federal legislation establishing minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. They reached out for help and we jumped in. 

## Solution

Through talking with users and reviewing website traffic patterns we found redundant and confusing processes for important tasks people came to the website to complete such as renewing a car registration. We identified the three main reasons visitors come to the DMV’s website and made small and focused changes to improve the DMV’s landing page, and streamline the online registration and license processes.

## Results

By addressing vital user needs and improving the overall customer experience, the total number of negative feedback has already decreased by over 20% in the three weeks since the changes were made. The DMV is also successfully fulfilling its federal requirements as mandated by the REAL ID Act.
