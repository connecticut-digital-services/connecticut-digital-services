  We made improvements to the DMV website to provide a better experience for
  customers.

Visitors to the Department of Motor Vehicles’s (DMV) website were becoming increasingly frustrated with their online experience. Users had trouble finding the information they needed. They spoke up, and we listened. Through talking with users and reviewing website traffic patterns we found redundant and confusing processes for important tasks people came to the website to complete, such as renewing a car registration.

We identified the three main reasons visitors come to the DMV’s website, and made small and focused changes to improve the DMV’s landing page, and streamline the online registration and license processes. By addressing vital user needs to improve the customer experience, the total number of negative feedback has decreased by over 20% in the three weeks since the changes were made.
