excerpt: We're making it easier to start and operate a business in Connecticut

Business One Stop (BOS) is a business portal designed to better serve the State of Connecticut’s business community. The goal is to make the process of opening a business  easy for all - from the most experienced business owner to the first-time entrepreneur.

At present, the digital experience for those seeking to do business in the state is cumbersome and frustrating. Information is siloed within individual agencies, business service points aren’t coordinated internally, and compliance and regulatory changes aren’t well tracked or understood. 

Once completed, BOS will offer capabilities ranging from simple organization of business documents to more robust, feature rich environments that allow business owners to register and manage their businesses completely online. It will also include access to updates around new legislative changes that would impact businesses.
