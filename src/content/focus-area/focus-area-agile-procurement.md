It shouldn’t be difficult to buy and manage technologies that help the government deliver better public services. But it is. [94 percent of large IT projects initiated between 2003 and 2012 failed in at least one critical way ](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/08/25/doomed-challenges-and-solutions-to-government-it-projects/)— they failed to meet deadlines, stay within budget, and meet user expectations. Some failed to deliver completely. 

We’re committed to doing things differently. Adopting modern procurement practices allows us to minimize risks and costs while more effectively meeting our users’ needs.

But what does that look like? Here's a few ways that agile procurement methods can be a game-changer:  

* Attract modern, high quality vendors
* Implement evaluation methods that require vendors to show rather than tell
* Move quickly from RFP posting to delivering a minimum viable product (MVP)
* Structure IT projects in a modular way
* Establish standards by which new systems must communicate with each other
* Seamlessly replace under-performing vendors
* Engage the vendor community to improve procurement processes
* Implement agile and modular procurement practices that emphasize functional software and user research throughout each project
* Foster multi-year funding through capital and operating budgets
