It shouldn’t be so hard to successfully buy and manage technology projects that help the government better deliver services to the public. But it is. The teams responsible for [94 percent of large IT projects initiated between 2003 and 2012 failed in at least one critical way ](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/08/25/doomed-challenges-and-solutions-to-government-it-projects/)— they failed to meet deadlines, failed to stay within budget, failed to meet user expectations, or failed to deliver completely. We’re committed to doing things differently. Adopting modern procurement practices allows us to minimize project risks and costs while more effectively meeting our users’ needs.

Here’s what shifting to more modern, agile procurement methods for technology projects looks like:  

* Attracting modern, high quality vendors
* Implementing evaluation methods that require vendors to show rather than tell
* Moving quickly from RFP posting to delivering a minimum viable product (MVP)
* Structuring IT projects in a modular way
* Establishing standards by which new systems must communicate with each other
* Seamlessly replacing under-performing vendors
* Engaging the vendor community to improve procurement processes
* Implementing agile and modular procurement practices that emphasize functional software and user research throughout each project
* Receiving ample multi-year funding through capital and operating budgets

If you are interested in learning more, we are working on an Agile Procurement Playbook that will provide a deep dive into the practices we’re adopting. _Stay tuned._
