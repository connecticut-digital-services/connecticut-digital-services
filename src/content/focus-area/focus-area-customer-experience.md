Our end goal is exceptional customer service. Government has been notorious for providing frustrating customer experiences. We want to start changing that. By transforming constituents’ interactions with us into accessible, useful, and even delightful digital experiences, we can restore their confidence in government and their willingness to engage.

Here are a list of questions we can ask ourselves as we we work toward putting users first: 

* Do we understand the needs and contexts of our users? 
* What pain points exist in everyday interactions with government?
* What service delivery changes can we make to improve those interactions?
* Are we creating and following uniform standards for user experience (e.g. content and style guides)?
* Are we addressing the user’s whole experience, from start to finish?
* Are we delivering a unified experience by bridging gaps between organizational silos seamlessly and behind the scenes?
* Are we helping to cultivate two-way communication between government and constituents?
* Are we communicating clearly and demonstrating self-awareness (even self-deprecation when it's warranted) in communication with constituents?
* Are we providing a consistent, high quality experience?

## Progress & Key Milestones

This is how the Connecticut Digital Service is charging ahead in this key focus area.
