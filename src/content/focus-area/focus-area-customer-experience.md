Government can be notorious for frustrating customer experiences. We're committed to change that. 

So we're shifting the way we do business. We're prioritizing value and offering service that is painless, seamless, and sometimes even delightful. 

Digital modernization will help us get there. By combining user-driven solutions with powerful analytics and support tools, we'll help restore constituents' trust in government. They'll have confidence that we understand their needs and are fully committed to their success. 

Here are the guideposts that fuel our new approach to customer experience:  

* Do we understand the needs and contexts of our users? 
* What pain points and challenges exist in their everyday interactions with government?
* What changes can we make to improve the way we help them get services?
* Are we creating and following uniform standards for user experience (e.g. content and style guides)?
* Are we addressing the user’s whole experience, from start to finish?
* Are we delivering a unified experience by bridging organizational silos - seamlessly and behind the scenes?
* Are we helping to cultivate clear two-way communication between government and constituents?
* Are we providing a consistent, high quality experience? How do we know?
