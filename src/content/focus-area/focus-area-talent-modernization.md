A key to digital transformation is cultivating a digitally mature workforce. This requires building up capacity and equipping our existing talent with new tools and resources. This will allow them to better navigate challenges and deliver user-centered services. Along with that, we want to attract subject matter rock stars from outside government.  

Here's how we're up-skilling workers recruiting top digital talent to the State:   

* Identify skills missing from existing teams
* Arm existing teams with the tools and resources they need to learn new skills and adopt modern standards
* Provide opportunities for career growth and professional development
* Cultivate networks of practice to develop and share ideas and best practices
* Attract high quality, diverse talent
* Quickly onboard and integrate new team members
* Cultivate an environment of collaboration and learning
* Establish and empower cross-functional delivery teams
* Provide teams the autonomy to develop internally consistent processes and values
* Develop a reputation for being a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive place to work
